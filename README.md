Hello, debuggers! Welcome to the *DIANA BugFixing Challenge*.

Here at DIANA, we’ve been groovin’ through the cosmos, spreading good vibes while handling ~~occasional~~ computer crashes.

A solar storm has deleted/changed some parts of the code, and now the Rover's class is all twisted up!\
Our Global Logic Investigation Taskforce for Code Hazards department, or **GLITCH** for short, has been on the case. But since all the other agents are busy with their own missions,
we need **you** to help us out!

You’ve got your hands on the code to the **Rover** class, along with its trusty sidekick, the **Payload**. Somewhere in this cosmic mess, things are off-beat. Your job is to fix it, but hey, it’s not just about fixing—it’s about making the Rover **rock**!

The Rover’s gotta pick up rocks, groove around the planet, and do it all without dropping the payload. Sound simple? Don’t be fooled by the beat—there are bugs, and they’re jammin’ hard.

## Instructions

Find the bugs in the code and correct them, making sure that **the code compiles** and the Rover and Payload classes work as expected.

There may be multiple types of bugs: syntax errors, logical errors, or even cosmic errors. You need to find them all and fix them.

## Expected Outputs

- Provide a simple `BUGS.txt` file containing the bugs that you found (specify line numbers and a brief description of the problem)

- Provide the fixed version of 'bugfixing.cpp'

## Challenge's score

Total Score: 300
